        <h2>Pipeline Description:</h2>
        <p>
          My CI/CD pipeline is a sophisticated automation process that ensures
          every code commit is built, tested, and deployed seamlessly to the
          production environment. The pipeline is implemented using GitHub
          Actions, which allows for a series of steps to be executed in response
          to triggers, typically a push to the main branch.
        </p>
        <p>
          The build process includes installing dependencies, compiling the
          code, and running any necessary scripts to prepare the application for
          deployment. Upon a successful build, automated tests are run to
          validate the functionality and integrity of the application, ensuring
          that new changes do not introduce bugs or regressions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deployment is handled through Azure App Service, providing a
          high-availability hosting environment for the web application. This is
          achieved through Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform, which
          allows for declarative configuration and management of cloud
          resources, ensuring consistency and reproducibility across
          environments. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This pipeline embodies the principles of continuous integration and
          continuous delivery, allowing for rapid iteration and robust
          deployment of web applications, with every change subject to automated
          quality checks and easy rollback if needed.
